                        <p>The Chamber of Mines of the Philippines (COMP) has moved to formally and officially adopt Canada’s sustainable mining model, Business Mirror reported Monday. The adoption of Toward Sustainable Mining (TSM), a mining-sustainability standard developed by the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), is in response to President Rodrigo Duterte’s call to the industry to be more responsible in doing business.</p>

                    <h4>Turf Industry</h4>
                    <p>
                        Summit Seed prides themselves in providing strong, cutting edge agronomic solutions for the turf industry. Our company focuses on high value products that provide excellent results for our customers. Our specialty is turf grass seed that includes seed mixtures designed for specific applications including: SOD Producers, Golf Course, Sports Turf, Residential Lawns and Low Maintenance Turf.<br>
                        Being located in Rockford, WA has allowed us to form several new west coast alliances to grow our “Sod Seed Division.” Our northwest relocation allowed us to be amongst the grass seed production areas, which gives us the ability to select and secure better and more innovative grass seed varieties.  Our west coast alliances will provide you with a more diverse product line up, readily available inventories and competitive west coast pricing coupled with research from some of the largest privately owned grass seed research facilities in the U.S., while ensuring the highest quality standards to all of our Summit Seed customers.  Let us share with you some of our leading edge genetics, allowing us all to become better turf managers as well as stewards of our land.
